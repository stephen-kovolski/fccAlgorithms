'cd -' brings you back to the directory you were just in.  Not just back up one.

$ ls -F /
$ - prompt
ls - command
-F - Option
/ - Argument

*****mkdir

Note that mkdir is not limited to creating single directories one at a time. The -p option allows mkdir to create a directory with nested subdirectories in a single operation:
$ mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results

The -R option to the ls command will list all nested subdirectories within a directory. Letâ€™s use ls -FR to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created in the project directory:
$ ls -FR ../project
--output below--
../project/:
data/  results/

../project/data:

../project/results:
